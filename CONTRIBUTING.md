## Before getting started

First, thank you for coming here. Glad that you found this project useful and, more than that, that you like to contribute and make the web a more welcoming place. Sticking with good practices is a hard task, and this project would never be ready without your help.

## How to contribute

**We are currently open to:**

* Increase the number of best practices
* Translations
* Grammar/typo fixes (always welcome!)
* Discussions about any practice described here that you find arbitrary.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

# Getting started

There are several ways you can help the project:

### 1. Creating a best practice

Please [see here](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md), for a more detailed instruction.

### 2. Translating the project

Follow the steps below so we can include your work on the repo:

1. `Fork` the main repository
2. Create a `branch` called _translation-YOUR_LANGUAGE_HERE_
3. Make your changes directly to the files there (keeping the same file/directory structure)
4. When you complete the translation, ping me at [@cezar_augusto](http://twitter.com/cezar_augusto), and I'll create the same `branch` name on the main repository
5. Make a `Pull Request` to send your `branch`'s updates to the repository here with the same name.

### 3. Fix some grammar/typo or anything content-related

You can either `fork` the project and submit your improvements or directly edit files here on Github. If you can't figure how to edit files, [this link](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) will make you ready in no time.
