## Why this? :two_hearts:

As we include more technologies into our stack, it's easy to neglect the needing to maintain a coding standard for HTML, which is the foundation for the Web developent. Despite all Linters and Checkers available, this Guideline enforces common coding principles and acclaimed best practices for writing scalable and sustainable HTML documents.

## Target Audience :family:

Anyone interessed in maitaining a coesive code, multidisciplinary teams, newcomers and seasoned developers looking to maintain a cohesive coding standard.
